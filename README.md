### Intended Gameplay

* Player 1's turn
	* Player 1 orients their pieces
	
	* Player 1 rolls the 2 dice
	
	* Player 1 makes their 2 moves


* Player 2's turn
	* Player 2 orients their pieces
	
	* Player 2 rolls the 2 dice
	
	* Player 2 makes their 2 moves


Different numbers mean different ways you can move.

The semantics of the two dice differ... for the 6 and 1?

I'll make a table here later of all the moves.
