### Intended Gameplay

On each turn, a player may orient any of their pieces to any of the four directions.
Then the player rolls the six (6) dice.
There are two types of dice,
which share the same actions for 2 to 5,
but differ in the meaning of 1 and 6.

Then the player chooses moves for each of the dice,
discarding the dice to the other player as they are used.

Different numbers mean different ways you can move.


I'll make a table here later of all the moves.

Each piece has two (2) "hitpoints" essentially.
A piece is turned over to represent it being "damaged".
When it loses both "hitpoints", it is removed from play.
Some moves can remove a piece at "full health" immediately.
